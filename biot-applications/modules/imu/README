Quaternion From Angular Velocity
==================================

The first step is to convert angular velocity into an axis angle.
w is angular velocity and t is the time period (sample rate of gyroscopes)
theta = |w|dt (ie magnitude of w = degrees/per sec * secs = degrees)
v = vector(w) (ie the direction of the rotation)

Using theta as the angle and v as the axis vector, itâ€™s possible to translate
this axis angle representation into a quaternion using the axis
angle to quaternion formula.


Axis Angle to Quaternion
-------------------------
v = axis, theta = angle

qw = cos(theta/2)
qx = vx . sin(theta/2)
qy = vy . sin(theta/2)
qz = vz . sin(theta/2)


code

eg

    double d[3] = { omega[0]*dt,  omega[1]*dt,  omega[2]*dt };
    double angle = vecLength(d);
    myQuat_t q;
    makeIdentityQuat(&q);
    if (angle != 0)
    {
        q.x = d[0] * sin(angle/2)/angle;
        q.y = d[1] * sin(angle/2)/angle;
        q.z = d[2] * sin(angle/2)/angle;
        q.w = cos(angle/2);
    }
    return q;
