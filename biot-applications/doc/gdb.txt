Debugging using ICE

Connect the ATMEL-ICE device to the board.

1. start openocd (openocd -f openocd.cfg)

2. start gdb
   arm-none-eabi-gdb -tui ../bin/samXXX/YYY.elf

   (this will open up 'tui' a "text gui" interface to gdb)

3. now while in tui (or gdb), target the remote board via openocd   

    target remote localhost:3333

    to start program running:
        continue

    to reset cpu:
         monitor reset init

    other bits:
        monitor resume (starts it running)
        monitor halt (stops it)

    show file:
        list main.c:1

    set breakpoint(s)
        b main.c:35
    
    show breakpoints:
        i b

    dump trace of stack after crash:
        bt
