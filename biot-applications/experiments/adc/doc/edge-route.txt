1. Set up ATSAMR21ZLL-EK board
    - standard usb to EDBG to program and then access shell via make clean all
      flash term

    - add FTDI to R232 connection (NB 3.3V NOT 5V!) between board and PC USB

2. on PC - create IPv6 over SLIP

    sudo ./tunslip6 affe::1/64 -t tun0 -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -B115200 
    (assuming FTDI gizmo assigned /dev/ttyUSB0)

    use ifconfig to verify there is now a tun0 interface with address affe::1/64

3. set address on board via RIOT shell

    ifconfig 8 add affe::2

    NB use interface number that is the 'wired' link interface (not the
    wireless one) in this example it is interface #8.
    
    Then use ipconfig to check the board now has an IPv6 6LoWPAN
    interface with address affe::2.

4. Set the neighbourhood cache manually to know about the PC address:

    ncache add 8 affe::1

5.  Test it works:

    from PC ping board:
        ping6 affe::2

    from board ping PC
        ping6 affe::1

6. Test udp connection ATSAMR21ZZL-EK --> PC

    - on PC do:
        nc -ul 8808
    - on board in shell do:
        udp send affe::1 8808 hello!
