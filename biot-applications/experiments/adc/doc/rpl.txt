IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
(RPL, pronounced “ripple”)

We have a lot of nodes in a sensor network.

We need a root node in the network.  It is the IPv6 gateway to the outside
world for the mesh of participating nodes.


Setting up RPL (Routing between nodes)
---------------------------------------

1. for each member of the RPL dodag

    get network interface id
    assume it is "6" on all of them (adjust below if not)

        rpl int 6


2. one node must be the root node.  Give it a global ipv6 address and make it
    root let it be "affe::2"
??(need to add address using ifconfig first? eg ifconfig 6 add affe::2)??
        rpl root 1 affe::2

    ("1" is the "instance ID" - whatever that is...)    

    Now each of the participating nodes will *magically* be assigned a global
    ipv6 address in the "affe" range eg:
        affe::5847:2c7d:4b62:c2a



3. from any non root you should now be able to ping the root nodes global address

        ping6 affe::2

    from the root node you should be able to ping any of the member nodes on
    their global address, eg

        ping6 affe::5847:2c7d:4b62:c2a
